# Create-a-simple-web-browser
In today’s world, almost everyone is using the internet. To access the world wide web we need a browser.

In this article, we will be creating a simple web browser with python and PyQT5.

PyQT is a widely used module which is used to make GUI applications with much ease. We can develop many complex GUI applications using PyQT very easily. It has a modern look and light user interface. Even if you are not familiar with this module, you will be able to create a web browser as each and every line is explained in the code itself using comments.

We often confused between the terms web browser and search engine, so let’s quickly have a look at these two terms.

Search Engine: It is used to search the required information from the World Wide Web using a web browser. It actually allows us to search the internet.

Web Browser: It is used to access the World Wide Web / Internet.

Now, you might have a clear picture of the mentioned terms. We can use any search engine, so we will be using Google search engine in our project.
